Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis in Excel
This Excel project analyzes a hotel booking cancellation dataset using Pivot Tables and charts to gain insights into booking trends. The dataset includes information on total cancellations categorized by guest type (Family, Single, and Couples) and evaluates desired vs. undesired room allotments based on these cancellations.

Key steps in the analysis:
âœ… Data Cleaning & Organization â€“ Structured the dataset for accurate calculations.
âœ… Pivot Table Analysis â€“ Calculated total cancellations per guest type.
âœ… Room Allocation Insights â€“ Identified trends in desired vs. undesired room allotments.
âœ… Visual Representation â€“ Created bar and pie charts for better understanding of cancellation trends.

This project helps in identifying booking patterns, improving room allocation strategies, and reducing cancellations. ðŸš€
